Scenarios
---------------------

The energy sector is assessed under two distinct scenarios: the Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario
and the Long-Term Strategy (LTS) scenario. The BAU scenario follows Jamaica's 2018 Integrated Resource Plan,
meeting growing energy demand through a mix of conventional and intermittent renewable sources, with no significant
improvements in transmission losses, energy efficiency, or electrification of cooking. In contrast, the LTS scenario
envisions a fully renewable energy system by 2050, with substantial reductions in transmission and distribution losses,
widespread adoption of energy-efficient technologies, electrification of cooking, and extensive use of energy storage to
support intermittent renewables. Long-Term Strategy (LTS) Actions. 

The actions modelled on the LTS scenario are:

• Deploy Intermittent Renewables up until 2038, the strategy aligns with the 2018 Jamaica Integrated Resource Plan.
• By 2050, the energy mix is projected to consist entirely of intermittent renewables.
• Reduce System Losses: Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses will be reduced to 8% by 2050.
• By 2038, 540 MW of battery energy storage systems (BESS) will be installed. 
• By 2050,BESS will account for 22% of the total installed capacity of power plants.
• Energy Demand Growth: Growth rates are according to Jamaica’s GDP.
• Cookers Electrification
    • By 2035, kerosene, wood, and charcoal stoves will be replaced with electrical options.
    • By 2050, no new LPG cookers will be in the market, and their use will be reduced to 9% of the BAU scenario.
• Energy Efficiency in Existing Buildings
    •	By 2030, solar water heating will replace 2% of traditional heaters, and 3% by 2050, relative to BAU.
    • In 2030, replace 100% of electric lighting with LED lamps (1,177,626 units), or equivalents, in residential, public, and commercial buildings.
    • In 2040, replace electrical units in existing buildings, relative to 2021:
        • 1,178,797 refrigeration units
        • 17,925 air conditioning (AC) units.
