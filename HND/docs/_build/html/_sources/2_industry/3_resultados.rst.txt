**Figure 6** shows that as LTS mitigation actions relate to energy use
(i.e., reduced fuel consumption in alumina consumption, reduced coal used in cement production
and overall energy intensity reduction) there are at least $0.4 billion in benefits. **Figure 7** illustrates the impact
of the clinker-to-cement reduction targeted by the LTS, which aims to lower the ratio from 95% in 2014 to 70% by 2030.
The results show that implementing this measure leads to an overall cost increase of $0.05 billion. Although there are
slight reductions in materials, energy, and water use, the strategy requires additional investments in equipment and
results in higher fixed costs, such as labour.
