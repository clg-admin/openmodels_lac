Specific Adaptation Strategies
===================================

The Human Settlements and Critical Infrastructure sectors of the LTS are closely connected, both aiming to strengthen Jamaica’s 
esilience to climate change. Human Settlements focus on addressing housing vulnerabilities, planning for coastal retreat, building
coastal defenses, and implementing microinsurance to aid disaster recovery. Meanwhile, Critical Infrastructure seeks to enhance the
resilience of water, power, and transport systems through infrastructure improvements, Nature-based Solutions (NbS), and better
institutional processes to ensure reliable services under climate stress.

The specific actions modeled under the LTS scenario are:

•	Construction of 2,500 housing units per year for lower-income groups in informal settlements.
•	Roll-out of 754 energy-efficient air conditioning units per year in urban and rural informal settlements.
•	Technical support to 5 microfinance institutions (MFIs) for developing microinsurance products.
•	Coverage of 1,392,000 people with microinsurance for disaster recovery.
•	Construction of 80 km of coastal defenses (grey infrastructure) to protect key assets.
•	Managed relocation of 324,373 people from high-risk coastal areas.
•	Conducting climate vulnerability and risk assessments (CCVAs) in 48 urban centers.
•	Construction of artificial wetlands for wastewater treatment, processing 6.02 million cubic meters/year, covering 5.3 hectares/year.
•	Construction of 1,644 km of new water pipelines by 2030, followed by 274 km/year after 2030.
•	Retrofitting 466 km of water supply pipelines per year and maintaining 466 km per year.
•	Retrofitting wastewater treatment plants to handle 0.64 million cubic meters/year.
•	Retrofitting sewerage pipelines for 2.48 million cubic meters/year.
•	Installation of 24 rainwater harvesting systems per year.
•	Reduction of non-revenue water (NRW) by 30%.
•	Retrofitting 450 km of roads per year (major works).
•	Rehabilitating 450 km of roads per year (minor works).
