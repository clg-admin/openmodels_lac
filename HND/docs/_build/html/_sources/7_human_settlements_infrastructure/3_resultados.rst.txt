**Figure 13** modeling results for the Human Settlement sector show that only housing solutions
(Action 2.1) currently have quantified benefits, amounting to $508.8 million, while the
total cost of all actions is approximately $3,048 million, resulting in a net cost of -$2,541.7
million. Significant data gaps exist, particularly for low-carbon cooling, coastal defenses,
and microinsurance, and further stakeholder engagement is needed to refine cost-benefit estimates.

For the Critical Infrastructure sector, results from **Figure 14** show the total benefits ($3,442 million) exceed costs
($1,110 million), yielding a net benefit of $2,332 million, largely driven by avoided costs
from a nationwide non-revenue water reduction program. While some actions show higher costs
than benefits, unquantified advantages like improved water quality, reduced flooding, and better
public health could further enhance the sectorâ€™s economic returns.
