Scenarios
===================================

The Forestry sector is modeled under two contrasting scenarios: a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario and a Long-Term Strategy (LTS)
scenario. Under BAU, forest resources continue to decline, with 0.46% annual deforestation and only 0.55% annual reforestation,
leading to a net loss of forest cover over time and increasing ecosystem vulnerability. In contrast, the LTS scenario presents a
proactive approach aimed at forest conservation and expansion to enhance climate resilience and ecosystem services. The strategy
emphasizes controlling deforestation, promoting reforestation, and restoring coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, 
aligning with broader environmental goals.

The actions modeled in the LTS scenario are:

  • Reduce deforestation by 30% from 2020 levels, curbing the loss of forested areas.

  • Achieve No-net-loss of forest cover by maintaining a balance between deforestation and reforestation.

  • Increase forest cover by 5% from 2020 levels, contributing to carbon sequestration and biodiversity protection.

  • Achieve an additional 3% increase in forest land cover by 2050, reinforcing long-term sustainability.

  • Restore 4,000 hectares of mangroves by 2050, enhancing coastal protection and ecological diversity.


For the Agricultural and Livestock sector the LTS scenario promotes sustainable land management
and climate-smart agricultural practices, aiming to balance agricultural productivity with environmental protection.
The strategy focuses on integrating agroforestry, reducing livestock emissions, and improving manure management to lower
greenhouse gas emissions and enhance productivity.

The actions modeled in the LTS scenario are:

  • Implement agroforestry systems on 10% of cropland (focused on coffee and cacao) by 2050.

  • Achieve a 14% reduction in livestock emissions by 2030 through:

    • Rotational pastures, reducing the enteric fermentation emission factor by 6%.

    • Improved livestock management and disease prevention, contributing an additional 3.45% reduction in enteric fermentation emissions and increasing productivity by 8%.

  • Reduce methane emissions by 20% from 2020 levels by 2030 through anaerobic digestion of manure.
