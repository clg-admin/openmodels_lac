Specific Adaptation Strategies
===================================

For this sector, the LTS envisions Jamaica adopting Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA), improving irrigation efficiency, shifting crop patterns
to match changing seasonality, and promote climate-resilient crops to strengthen its agricultural sector against
climate change. These actions are expected to enhance productivity, conserve resources, and secure livelihoods,
leading to a more resilient agricultural sector and sustainable economic growth. 
 
The specific actions modeled under the LTS scenario are:

  •	Agroforestry systems with hedgerows on 10% of cropland (34,100 ha by 2050).
  •	Contour ditches on 10% of one-third of cropland (11,366 ha by 2050).
  •	Crop rotation (maize/bean) on 30% of the area cultivated with maize and beans by 2050.
  •	Heat and water stress-tolerant varieties on 5% of cropland (17,050 ha by 2050).
  •	Pest and disease-tolerant varieties on 5% of cropland (17,050 ha by 2050).
  •	Conservation tillage on 5% of cropland (17,050 ha by 2050).
  •	Increase irrigation by 20% of cropland (4,978.6 ha), with half under drip irrigation and half under sprinkler irrigation.
  •	Replace 30% of maize used in animal feed with cassava root meal.
