 **Table 11** presents key data points and sources used in the evaluation of climate-smart agriculture (CSA). These data support the assessment of labor costs, benefits,
 and technical parameters associated with various CSA interventions, such as agroforestry,
 contour ditches, smart irrigation, and improved crop varieties. The values are derived from reputable national and
 international studies, with contextual adaptations

   * - **Data point description**
     - **Source**
   * - Agroforestry systems with hedgerows - Installation Labor cost. Cropland is 31.3% of total country land (1,090,000 ha). Estimated cropland 341,000 ha. 10% target = 34,100 ha over 25 years = 1,364 ha/year.
     - Costs and benefits of climate-smart agriculture: The case of the Dry Corridor in Guatemala - ScienceDirect
   * - Agroforestry systems with hedgerows - Maintenance Labor cost. 17,732 ha/year is the mean annual area for implementation from 2025 to 2050.
     - Costs and benefits of climate-smart agriculture: The case of the Dry Corridor in Guatemala - ScienceDirect
   * - Contour ditches - Installation Labor cost. 384,000 ha with slopes <10°. Assume 10% of suitable cropland = 11,366 ha over 25 years = 455 ha/year.

     - Costs and benefits of climate-smart agriculture: The case of the Dry Corridor in Guatemala - ScienceDirect
   * - Soil loss avoided by conservation tillage. 133 t/ha/year * 8,525 ha = 1,133,825 t/year * 0.008 USD/t.
     - Costs and benefits of climate-smart agriculture: The case of the Dry Corridor in Guatemala - ScienceDirect
   * - Increase in yields from CSA. 30% yield increase on 10% cropland = 1,711,260 USD/year. Export impact: 603 t * 2,837 USD/t.
