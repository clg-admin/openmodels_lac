This documentation is based on the development process of Jamaica's Long-Term Emission Reduction and Climate Resilient Strategy (LTS), 
led by the Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation in collaboration with the 2050 Pathways Platform. 
The LTS sets Jamaica's pathway to net zero emissions and increased climate resilience by 2050. This project supports decision-making by 
evaluating the costs and benefits of the LTS, addressing social, economic, and environmental impacts, and identifying key opportunities and
challenges for its implementation.
