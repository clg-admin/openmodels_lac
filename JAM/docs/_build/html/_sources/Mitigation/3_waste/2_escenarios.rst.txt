Scenarios
===================================

The Waste Management sector is assessed under two scenarios: a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario
and a Long-Term Strategy (LTS) scenario. Under the BAU scenario, no significant improvements are
made in waste separation, recycling, or composting, and organic matter continues to accumulate in
landfills without targeted reduction efforts. Additionally, there are no specific measures to improve
waste infrastructure or implement waste-to-energy initiatives.

In contrast, the LTS scenario proposes a shift towards more sustainable waste management practices,
focusing on reducing organic matter in landfills, enhancing recycling and composting, and improving
wastewater recycling. However, several actions in this sector remain qualitative and require further
data for full consideration, particularly regarding waste-to-energy projects and regulatory development.

The actions modeled in the LTS scenario are:

**Waste management**
  •	50% reduction of organic matter in landfills relative to 2020 levels via composting 


**Reduce the adverse impacts of waste on the environment and public safety**
  •	By 2035, 50% of domestic wastewater will be recycled
  •	Sanitary landfills deployed, and controlled landfills closed, enabling effective composting operations.
