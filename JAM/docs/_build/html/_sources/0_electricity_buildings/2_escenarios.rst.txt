Scenarios
---------------------

The energy sector is assessed under two distinct scenarios: the Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario
and the Long-Term Strategy (LTS) scenario. The BAU scenario follows Jamaica's 2018 Integrated Resource Plan,
meeting growing energy demand through a mix of conventional and intermittent renewable sources, with no significant
improvements in transmission losses, energy efficiency, or electrification of cooking. In contrast, the LTS scenario
envisions a fully renewable energy system by 2050, with substantial reductions in transmission and distribution losses,
widespread adoption of energy-efficient technologies, electrification of cooking, and extensive use of energy storage to
support intermittent renewables. Long-Term Strategy (LTS) Actions. 

The actions modelled on the LTS scenario are:

**Deployment of Renewable Energies**
    * Until 2038, the strategy aligns with the 2018 Jamaica Integrated Resource Plan.
    * By 2050, the energy mix is projected to consist entirely of intermittent renewables.


**Systems losses**
    * Transmission and distribution lossess will be reduced by 8% by 2050.



**Energy Demand Growth**
    * According to JamaicaÂ´s GDP



**Energy storage**
    * By 2038, 540 MW of battery energy storage systems (BEES) will be installed.
    * BESS will account for 22 % of the total installed capacity of power plants.



**Cookers electrification**
    * In 2035, kerosene, wood and charcoal stoves will be replaced with electrical options.
    * By 2050, no new LPG cookers will be in the market, and the amount in use will be reduced to 9 % of the BAU scenario.



**Energy efficiency**
    * Use of solar water heating will be reduced 2 % of traditional heaters by 2030, and 3 % by 2050.
    * In 2030, replace 100 % of electric lighting with LED lamps.
    * In 2040, replace electrical units in existing buildings, relative to 2021:  
        * 1 ,178 ,797 refrigeration units. 
        * 17 ,925 AC units.
