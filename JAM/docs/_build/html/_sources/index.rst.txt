JAM-LTS Documentation
===================================================

The 2050 Long-term Emission Reduction and Climate Resilient Strategy (LTS) outlines Jamaicaâ€™s pathway to a low-carbon,
resilient economy by 2050, in alignment with the Paris Agreement. This strategy was developed through detailed modeling
of mitigation and adaptation actions. The project focuses on assessing the costs and benefits of the LTS to support informed
decision-making and ensure alignment with national development priorities.
