The preliminary results in **Figure 9** indicate that implementing the LTS yields $0.5 billion
in net benefits compared to the BAU scenario. Although the LTS involves $0.3 billion in additional
costs for new infrastructure and operations, these are outweighed by significant health and environmental gains.
Key benefits include $0.4 billion in savings from reduced waste-related diseases, $0.15 billion from avoiding water
contamination, and $0.25 billion from circular economy advantages.
