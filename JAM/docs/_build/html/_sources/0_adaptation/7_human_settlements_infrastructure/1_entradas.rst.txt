 **Table 16** presents key data points and their respective sources used in
 the analysis of adaptation strategies across sectors. These data encompass cost estimations for infrastructure,
 ecosystem services valuation, and benefits derived from avoided losses due to climate adaptation measures. The sources
 include governmental reports, international studies, and technical assessments, ensuring a comprehensive foundation for
 evaluating both economic investments and returns associated with adaptation actions.
