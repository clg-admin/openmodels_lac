===================================
Specific Adaptation Strategies
===================================

Jamaica’s Long‑Term Strategy advances three interconnected adaptation pillars. First, reef restoration will scale up the re‑attachment of detached corals across 62.5 ha annually from 2025 to 2028 and 160 ha annually from 2029 to 2050. Second, mangrove conservation and restoration will remove fouling debris and pursue planting, afforestation, and relocation to recover 4 000 ha—about 160 ha each year—between 2025 and 2050. Third, climate‑risk preparedness will be reinforced by upgrading the flood early‑warning system once during 2025‑2027, expanding the network of monitoring stations, and deploying cost‑effective, real‑time data‑relay mechanisms for stakeholders; quantitative targets for the communication upgrades are still under development.

   * - Expand mangrove conservation and restoration
     - Removal of loose fouling materials, planting, afforestation, relocation
     - Increase 4 000 ha of mangroves (2025‑2050)
       ≈ 160 ha yr⁻¹
