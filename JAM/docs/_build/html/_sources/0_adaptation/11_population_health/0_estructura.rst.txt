===================================
Specific Adaptation Strategies
===================================

Jamaica’s Long-Term Strategy (LTS) for the Population and Health sector seeks to ensure a resilient and healthy population
by 2050 through equitable access to healthcare, improved sanitation, and strengthened infrastructure to cope with climate-induced health risks.
The LTS outlines specific actions with detailed strategies aimed at improving water quality, promoting healthier lifestyles, strengthening disaster response, and enhancing public health systems.

In alignment with the objectives established in the Long-Term Strategy (LTS), we identified a set of priority actions to enhance
climate resilience and adaptive capacity across key sectors. For each of these actions, we developed corresponding adaptation strategies
that are context-specific and implementation-ready. These strategies are paired with clear, measurable targets to ensure progress can be tracked effectively
and aligned with national development priorities. The following sections present these actions, strategies, and targets, along with their sources of justification or funding. **Table 23**
shows the strategies for the sector.
