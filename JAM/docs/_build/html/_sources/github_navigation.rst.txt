Github Navigation
====================================

GitHub is a version control platform where projects are organized in repositories. Below, we show you how to efficiently explore a repository.


**Structure of a Repository**

A GitHub repository generally has the following structure:

    - README.md: Welcome file with a description of the project.
    - docs/: Folder containing the project documentation (including .rst files).
    - Elec_Buil_Indus/: Source code for the Electricity and Buildings and Industry model.
    - Transport/: Source code for the Transport model.
    - Waste/: Source code for the Waste model.
    - AFOLU/: Source code for the 8.	Land-use change, forestry and agriculture model.
    - KLEM/: Source code for the Adaptation model.
    - requirements.txt: Project dependencies (Python libraries needed to run the simulation).
    - .github/: Configurations for CI/CD, issue templates, and PRs (only available on the PC when the repository is cloned).

**How to Explore Files in GitHub**

    - Use the Search Bar – On the repository page, use the search bar to find specific files or directories.

    - View Change History – Each file has a change history accessible from the "History" tab or the # Commits option, under the green <> Code button.

    - Download the Code – You can download the repository as a .zip file by left-clicking the green <> Code button and then left-clicking the Download ZIP option. You can also clone it using the following command via Git Bash: git clone https://github.com/clg-admin/JAM-LTS
