===================================
Specific Adaptation Strategies
===================================

Based on the Long-Term Strategy (LTS) objectives, a series of targeted adaptation strategies were developed to strengthen forest
governance, biodiversity conservation, and ecosystem restoration in Jamaica. For forest governance and biodiversity conservation,
actions include revising the Forest Act, integrating the forest sector into national decision-making, improving land tenure management,
expanding boundary verification, and developing invasive species control plans. These are scheduled for implementation primarily between
2027 and 2031, with some extending to 2050. In the area of agroforestry and ecosystem restoration, key interventions aim to increase forest
and mangrove cover across over 18,000 hectares, strengthen conservation efforts, and implement 72 Forest Management Plans. Additional measures
include plant nursery expansion, silviculture training, tree data monitoring, and the establishment of demo plots and permanent sample plots. Other
innovations involve installing a tissue culture lab, planting 1.2 million native trees, and running awareness campaigns and legal reforms for ancient
tree protection. Monitoring and reporting mechanisms are aligned with REDD+ and Cancun safeguards and supported by national plans such as the PMER PLAN
2021–2026 and validated stakeholder inputs. Together, these strategies provide a structured path to improve forest resilience, governance, and ecosystem
sustainability
