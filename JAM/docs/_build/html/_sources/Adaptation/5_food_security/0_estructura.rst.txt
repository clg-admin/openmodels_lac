===================================
Specific Adaptation Strategies
===================================

As part of the Long-Term Strategy (LTS), specific actions were identified to enhance climate resilience in Jamaica’s agriculture sector.
Based on the objectives outlined in the LTS, a set of targeted adaptation strategies was developed for the sector, each linked to clear, measurable goals.
These strategies focus on Climate-Smart Agriculture, improved irrigation systems, and the adoption of climate-resilient crops. Key interventions include expanding
agroforestry, conservation tillage, crop rotation, terrace farming, and the integration of technologies such as cold storage and drones—covering up to 34,100 hectares and
delivering 6,000 training sessions. Irrigation efforts prioritize rainwater harvesting, drip and subsurface systems, alongside training for 2,500 farmers. Crop substitution
strategies promote climate-tolerant varieties across 5% of cropland and include innovations such as insect farming, hydroponics, cassava feed alternatives, and sweet potato
initiatives. All actions are aligned with national development plans, including Vision 2030 Jamaica, and have been validated through stakeholder consultations.
