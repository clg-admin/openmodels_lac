The modelling results for Jamaicaâ€™s Tourism sector reveal that adaptation actions yield
net benefits of $103 million USD between 2025 and 2050, with benefits significantly outweighing costs as shown in **Figure 15**.
The Long-Term Strategy promotes nature-based solutions like coral reef restoration and beach nourishment
to protect coastal ecosystems, along with tourism diversification into rural and eco-tourism. These measures
enhance resilience, reduce environmental pressure, and ensure strong economic returns despite high initial investments.
