===================================
Specific Adaptation Strategies
===================================

As part of the Long-Term Strategy (LTS) to safeguard cultural heritage assets, Jamaica developed a climate-resilient
inventory and risk management system that outlines ten specific adaptation measures. These interventions aim to enhance
the structural, functional, and environmental resilience of heritage sites through the installation of protective infrastructure
and efficiency upgrades. The strategy includes elevating buildings and equipment, installing wind-resistant roof components, impact-resistant
windows and doors, and adopting efficient water and energy systems such as high-efficiency toilets, water-saving fixtures, and rainwater collection
tanks. Other measures include adding insulation, using lightweight construction materials, and double-glazed windows. Each measure is to be implemented
at two heritage sites per year from 2025 to 2045. These actions are drawn from regional resilience studies and reflect Jamaicaâ€™s commitment to preserving
its cultural heritage in the face of climate risks.
