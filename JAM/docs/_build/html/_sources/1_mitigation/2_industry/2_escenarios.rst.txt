Scenarios
---------------------

The Industry sector is analyzed under two scenarios: a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario and a Long-Term Strategy (LTS) scenario.
The BAU scenario assumes limited technological and efficiency improvements, with minor adjustments to production processes.
In this scenario, the clinker-to-cement ratio is reduced to 82% by 2025 and remains unchanged through 2050, with no additional
efforts to reduce energy use or coal consumption in industrial operations. In contrast, the LTS scenario outlines a more ambitious pathway
aimed at reducing emissions and improving resource efficiency across key industrial activities. The strategy focuses on deeper reductions
in clinker content, significant energy efficiency improvements, coal reduction in cement production, and enhanced mining practices aligned with
international standards.

The actions modeled in the LTS scenario are:

**Clinker**
  * The clinker-to-cement ratio is reduced to 82 % in 2025 and to 70 % by 2050.



**Efficiency improvements**
  * By 2030, fuel consumption for alumina processing is cut 25 % relative to 2020.  
  * By 2040, industry-sector energy intensity (energy per unit of output) is reduced 15 % from 2020 levels.



**Reduction of coal**
  * By 2040, coal use in cement production falls 6 % compared with 2020 levels.



**Efficient mining processes**
  * By 2040, an energy intensity of 105 MJ per tonne of bauxite extracted is achieved.
