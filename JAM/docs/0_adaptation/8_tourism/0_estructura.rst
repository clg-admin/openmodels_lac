===================================
Specific Adaptation Strategies
===================================

To support the Long-Term Strategy (LTS) objectives for coastal resilience, sustainable tourism, watershed protection, and protected areas management,
Jamaica identified a wide range of adaptation strategies. These strategies target five key areas: engineering solutions for beach protection, reducing
overfishing and illegal fishing, diversifying eco-tourism, implementing nature-based solutions (NbS) for coastal zones, and improving land and watershed
management through green infrastructure. Specific actions include scaling up the use of ShoreLock for beach stabilization, expanding marine sanctuaries,
training aquaculture farmers, enhancing enforcement, and upgrading heritage sites. Other interventions aim to mainstream NbS like beach nourishment and coral
reef restoration, though many of these currently lack quantified targets. A comprehensive suite of green infrastructure practices has also been proposed to reduce
runoff and sedimentation, such as bioretention systems, permeable pavements, and restored wetlands. In parallel, Jamaica is strengthening its protected areas system
through improved governance, awareness campaigns, capacity building, and stakeholder engagement. These strategies are supported by national plans and policies, including
the Strategic Business Plan for Tourism and Fisheries and the Overarching Policy for Jamaica’s Protected Areas System.
