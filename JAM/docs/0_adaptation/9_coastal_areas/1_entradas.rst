Cost and Benefit Data
===================================


This section presents **Table 20**, which summarizes the costs and benefits related
to ecosystem-based coastal management and monitoring systems in Jamaica. The data include restoration
of coral reefs and mangroves, as well as enhancements to flood early warning systems. These actions
contribute to climate resilience by protecting coastal areas, improving biodiversity, and preventing disaster-related losses.
