===================================
Specific Adaptation Strategies
===================================

Jamaica’s LTS adaptation package strengthens settlements and infrastructure on four fronts: safer housing and cooling, coastal protection,
water-system upgrades, and climate-resilient transport. The programme will build 2 500 storm-resistant homes each year, replace or install
about 750 high-efficiency air-conditioning units, and extend micro-insurance to five financial institutions that together serve roughly 1.4
million people. Coastal resilience is addressed through 80 kilometres of new seawalls combined with the managed relocation of more than 300
hectares of erosion-prone shoreline. Forty-eight urban centres will complete climate-vulnerability and risk assessments, while new artificial
wetlands will polish around 6 million cubic metres of wastewater annually. Water security is boosted by 1 644 kilometres of new pipelines by
2030, ongoing retrofits and maintenance of 466 kilometres per year, upgrades to sewers and treatment plants, 24 additional rain-water harvesting
systems each year, and a 30 percent cut in non-revenue water. Transport resilience hinges on overhauling 450 kilometres of minor roads annually
and climate-proofing an equal length of major routes. Together, these measures create an integrated pathway for safeguarding lives, services,
and economic activity in a changing climate.
