The modeling results in **Figure 11** show that adaptation actions in the Food Security sector provide
a net benefit of $19.4 million, with benefits exceeding costs between 2025 and 2050. A key
contributor is climate-smart agriculture, which generates $21.2 million in productivity gains.
This strategy, covering multiple specific actions, has the greatest impact. Beyond monetary value,
the actions improve food security, reduce malnutrition risks, and support ecological sustainability.
