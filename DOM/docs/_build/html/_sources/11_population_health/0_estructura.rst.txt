Jamaica’s Long-Term Strategy (LTS) for the Population and Health sector seeks to ensure a resilient and healthy population by 2050 through equitable access to healthcare, improved sanitation, and strengthened infrastructure to cope with climate-induced health risks. The LTS outlines specific actions with detailed strategies aimed at improving water quality, promoting healthier lifestyles, strengthening disaster response, and enhancing public health systems.

  - Construction of 40 new public parks or green areas by 2050 (five every three years).
  - Upgrading 25 community sports facilities annually.
  - Annual provision of 250 waste bins, bi-annual procurement of garbage trucks, and annual waste management assessments to ensure hygiene in community spaces.

- Shock-Responsive Social Safety Net:
  
  - Doubling of the National Disaster Fund’s annual disbursement capacity.
  - $200 USD cash grants to 75,000 families every two years post-disasters.
  - Allocation of $3 million USD every two years for post-disaster rehabilitation.
