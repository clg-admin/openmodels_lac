The results of the modeling process show that the adaptation actions for the Population and Health sector yield
substantial economic returns, with benefits significantly surpassing costs. As illustrated in **Figure 18**, the net
benefit amounts to US$1,304 million for the period 2025â€“2050. The most significant benefit comes from improving
water quality and access, which alone contributes US$1,305 million, primarily through avoided healthcare costs for water-borne diseases.
This is achieved by implementing measures such as the Water Supply Development Strategy for Non-Utility Service Areas, at a cost of US$158 million.
