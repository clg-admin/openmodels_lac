Specific Adaptation Strategies
===================================

The LTS for the tourism sector envisions a climate-resilient industry driven by ecosystem-based solutions, disaster risk management, and sustainable tourism planning. The strategy focuses on diversifying tourism offerings, protecting coastal ecosystems, and enforcing sustainable practices while encouraging economic diversification to minimize climate-related risks. These efforts aim to balance environmental conservation with economic development by safeguarding natural assets critical to tourism.

The specific actions modeled under the LTS scenario are:

  •	Use ShoreLock technology to improve coastal protection for 750 meters every five years.
  •	Increase fish sanctuary coverage to 20,000 hectares by 2026, with 4,200 hectares per year from 2025 to 2026, and hold 2 consultations in 2024.
  •	Train 34 farmers per year in aquaculture from 2023 to 2026, and 45 farmers per year from 2026 to 2027.
  •	Monitor 324 fishing sites annually from 2023 to 2027 to enhance enforcement.
  •	Upgrade 3 eco-tourism destinations per year from 2025 to 2046, including installing 26 storyboards and 12 directional signs at heritage sites.
  •	Develop a Tourism Strategy and Action Plan every 10 years, from 2025 to 2045.
  •	Create a Tourism Destination Development and Management Plan for 3 eco-tourism destinations per year, from 2025 to 2046.
  •	Develop a comprehensive private sector strategy for protected areas management by 2025.
  •	Revise Jamaica’s National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) by 2025, integrating biodiversity targets.
  •	Integrate climate adaptation measures into 10 protected area plans over 10 years, from 2025 to 2035.
  •	Develop the National Mangrove and Swamp Forest Management Plan in 2025 and implement it from 2026 to 2035.
  •	Conduct 30 capacity building programs over 10 years, from 2025 to 2035 (3 programs per year).
  •	Implement 10 public education programs over 5 years, from 2025 to 2030 (2 per year).
  •	Conduct 2 marketing research studies each year from 2026 to 2027 to promote awareness of protected areas.
  •	Allocate US$157,500 over 5 years (US$31,500 per year from 2025 to 2030) to maintain the National Protected Area Database.
