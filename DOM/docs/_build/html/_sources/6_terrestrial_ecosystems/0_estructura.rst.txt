===================================
Specific Adaptation Strategies
===================================

This chapter of the LTS focuses on the preservation and restoration of terrestrial ecosystems,
with a particular emphasis on forest conservation as a key strategy to combat climate change,
safeguard biodiversity, and maintain essential ecosystem services. These efforts are designed to
enhance ecological resilience, secure funding for conservation, and foster participatory governance,
thereby supporting sustainable development across Jamaica. To achieve these goals, the LTS outlines a series
of actions that are directly linked to specific strategic interventions in the forestry sector.

The specific actions modeled under the LTS scenario are:

  •	Implement a cross-sectoral mechanism to integrate the forest sector into national decision-making processes, with all actions aligned with an extended target of the National Forest Management and Conservation Plan (NFMCP) 2021-2026, expanded for five additional years (2027–2031).
  •	Amend the Forest Act and associated regulations, continuing under the extended NFMCP timeline.
  •	Prepare and update Development Orders related to forest management priorities, aligned with the extended NFMCP.
  •	Facilitate the transfer of crown lands from the Commissioner of Lands to the Forestry Department, continuing within the extended NFMCP timeframe.
  •	Strengthen governance approaches concerning tenure and trespass on forest estates, in line with the extended NFMCP goals.
  •	Develop regulations for permitting special recreational use, research, leasing, and performance bonds, following the extended NFMCP targets.
  •	Expand and accelerate the boundary verification program for forest estates, continuing within the 2027–2031 NFMCP extension.
  •	Maintain a list of invasive species and establish a working group for their control, with this strategy extended until 2050.
  •	Develop pilot species conservation plans and map distributions of targeted species, continuing until 2050.

Further efforts to expand sustainable forest management and increase forest coverage include:

  •	Continuation and expansion of the nursery programme until 2028, reaching a production capacity of 618,000 seedlings per year.
  •	Increase forest cover by 5% from 2025 to 2030, and an additional 3% from 2030 to 2050.
  •	Increase mangrove cover by 4,000 hectares between 2025 and 2050.
  •	Improve and develop Forest Management Plans (FMP), with one plan prepared every three years.
  •	Complete remaining 20% of riparian forest management practices from 2027 to 2030, with 80% scheduled for completion by 2026.
  •	Provide silviculture training for five additional departments, one per year over five years.
  •	Improve species data availability, cataloging one species every two years until 2050.
  •	Install 11 additional weather stations by 2050.
  •	Establish Permanent Sample Plots (PSP), with 4 PSPs implemented annually, totaling 92 PSPs between 2027 and 2050.
  •	Implement forest conservation measures in reforested areas, with 14,500 hectares under conservation by 2050.
