The implementation of the LTS in coastal areas demonstrates that significant upfront investments in ecosystem restoration yield substantial long-term gains, with net benefits of $664 million USD from 2025 to 2050. Actions like coral reef and mangrove restoration provide critical climate resilience and socio-economic advantages, including coastal protection and sustainable livelihoods. As shown in **Figure 16**, coral restoration offers the highest long-term economic benefits despite its high costs.
